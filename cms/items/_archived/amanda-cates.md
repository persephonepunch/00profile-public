How USC changed my life:
------------------------

USC gave me the space to explore my curiosity and sharpen my ambition. Through rigorous coursework, group projects and late-night strategy sessions, I learned how to lead with both precision and intention. It is where I learned that metrics aren't just numbers; they're stories of progress. Most importantly, USC surrounded me with people who believed in excellence, collaboration and growth. Professors, peers and mentors pushed me to think bigger, engage in thoughtful dialogue and never settle for "good enough."

A favorite memory:
------------------

My most memorable experience at the Moore School was the deep sense of connection and camaraderie I built with my cohort. From evening classes after long workdays to collaborating on group projects during the weekends, we learned together, grew together and celebrated each other's wins. These friendships were forged through shared ambition, mutual support and countless moments of laughter and growth. Equally unforgettable were the professors who challenged us to think critically, lead with purpose, and apply our learning to real-world problems. Their passion and mentorship elevated every classroom experience and inspired me to push beyond what I thought possible. Together with my peers and professors, I did not just earn a degree. I gained a community, a new lens for leadership and memories that will stay with me well beyond my time at the Moore School.

Advice for incoming students:
-----------------------------

Start with intention. Don't chase grades – chase understanding. Don't simply ask yourself what you're learning, but why it matters and how you'll use it to make a difference. Build relationships early. Your professors, peers and mentors are catalysts in your learning experience. Engage with them, challenge ideas and welcome feedback. The best growth happens in dialogue. Own your time. College will throw a thousand opportunities your way. Choose the ones that stretch your thinking and build the skills you'll need long after graduation. Document your wins. Whether it's a breakthrough in a group project or a moment of clarity during office hours, track your progress. These reflections will fuel your confidence and shape your story. And finally, lead with both heart and rigor. The University of South Carolina will give you tools, but it's up to you to turn them into impact. Be bold, be curious and never underestimate the power of learning.

What I've learned about myself:
-------------------------------

That I'm far more capable than I ever gave myself credit for. The unknown or unfamiliar isn't something to fear, but something to embrace. Every challenge, every pivot, every moment of uncertainty taught me that growth lives beyond comfort. I learned to trust my instincts, lean into complexity, and show up with confidence even when the path wasn't clear. College instilled resilience, adaptability and the power of believing in myself. I am reminded that when I meet the unknown with courage and curiosity, I can achieve more than I could ever imagine.

What played a role in my success:
---------------------------------

Every professor I encountered at USC played a role in shaping my success – not just by teaching content, but by modeling curiosity, discipline and purpose. They challenged me to think critically, communicate with precision, and connect ideas to real-world outcomes. Whether it was a lecture that sparked a new perspective or feedback that pushed me to refine my work, each interaction helped me grow. Their commitment to excellence, their willingness to engage, and their belief in student potential created an environment where I could stretch, stumble and ultimately succeed. I'm grateful to every professor who saw beyond the syllabus and invested in my growth. Their influence will echo in every decision I make moving forward.

What's next:
------------

After graduation, I'm planning to continue working with Aflac. When I first started the program, I had a fairly narrow view of what a career in insurance could look like. But over time, I've been exposed to so many different paths – analytics, strategy, project management, HR – that I can now better see how my strengths can evolve in multiple directions. It's given me a clearer sense of where I can grow professionally, and I'm excited to keep building on that.
