`Balancing work and 'prestigious' PMBA program Professional MBA graduate reflects on valuable experience of program and immediate real-time applications to his current Volvo role      Professional MBA candidate Eric Abdullah, '25, had to trade his Clemson tiger stripes for Gamecock spurs to enroll in the Darla Moore School's Professional MBA program, but as he approaches graduation, he says he has gained so much valuable experience in the PMBA program.      Drawn by the Moore School's national reputation for excellence and the flexibility of the PMBA program, Abdullah saw it as the ideal place to elevate his career while continuing to work full time. He is currently an indirect procurement buyer for Volvo Car USA.      Though choosing USC's PMBA program meant leaving behind his undergraduate roots at Clemson, he knew the Moore School offered the prestige, rigor and real-world relevance he needed to grow as a business leader. "The Moore School has a reputation for one of the best MBA programs in the country, and I wanted to complete my MBA at a prestigious business school," Abdullah says.      While the program's reputation stood out, its structure played an equally important role in his decision. "The PMBA also offered a very flexible schedule, which made it appealing so I could complete classes around my work schedule," he says. "Coming from Clemson, it was naturally a tough moral decision, but the right decision nonetheless!"      The Professional MBA program aligned perfectly with Abdullah's career goals. Already building a career in supply chain, he found the course offerings and specializations directly relevant. "It gave me the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of advanced business concepts and apply what I learned directly to my job in real time," he says.      Collaboration has been a key part of Abdullah's experience. "My classmates have been a great resource for me in the program and in the business world as well," he says. "It's been incredibly valuable to hear their insights on class topics shaped by their perspectives of their professions and industries."      Balancing work and academics was still challenging. "It's hard to find time for assignments on weekdays," Abdullah says. "I found early on that it's extremely important to block time on weekends to complete class responsibilities."      One of the most valuable lessons from the program has been thinking strategically and critically in his role. "In my current procurement role, part of my responsibility is to create long-term value, not just quick wins," he says. "The case discussions in the PMBA program have informed the sourcing strategies I develop at work."      Looking ahead, Abdullah plans to leverage his Professional MBA experience to advance in his career as the program has enhanced his skills and growth. "The program has strengthened my skills, and I intend to use that growth to position myself for a future leadership role within my organization," Abdullah says.`
