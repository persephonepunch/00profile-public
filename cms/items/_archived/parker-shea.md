`Learning 'cross-cultural communication, teamwork and tenacity' Graduate gets to live his passion in Asia through multiple experiences      For Parker Shea, '25 economics and international business, the Darla Moore School of Business offered a way to turn his curiosity about the world into a career. "The International Business and Chinese Enterprise (IBCE) cohort immediately stood out to me," Shea says. "It offered an experience that went far beyond the classroom — one that connected me directly to Asia and let me study global business from both sides of the world."      Pairing international business with economics gave Shea a well-rounded foundation for understanding global policy and markets. "Out of the Moore School majors, economics seemed to fit best with my interests," he says. "I've really enjoyed the upper-level economics courses I've taken at USC — they've challenged me to think critically about real-world systems and how global economies operate."      Beyond academics, Shea found community in Sigma Omega Upsilon, a professional international business fraternity that provided a network of mentors and peers. "Joining SOU my freshman year was one of my best decisions," he says. "It helped me develop my professional skills and gave me a strong community to come back to after studying abroad."      That study abroad experience — in both Taiwan and Hong Kong — proved transformative. In Taiwan, Shea lived in the heart of Taipei's Shida night market, immersing himself in the pace and rhythm of city life. Later, while studying at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, he found himself drawn to urban infrastructure and the city's remarkable efficiency. "Having lived in Columbia for 19 years, arriving in Taiwan was a major change," he says. "In Hong Kong, the subway system especially had a big impact on me — it sparked my interest in public policy and urbanism."      While in Hong Kong, Shea also joined the championship-winning dragon boat team, one of his most memorable experiences abroad. "Dragon boat was absolutely my favorite thing I did in Hong Kong," he says. "I started off as a complete novice but ended up making local friends I still keep in touch with. It taught me cross-cultural communication, teamwork and tenacity — and I even picked up some Cantonese."      Back in South Carolina, he gained hands-on experience through internships with the South Carolina House of Representatives and SC Economics, applying his classroom lessons to public policy and education initiatives.      After graduation, Shea will teach in China, likely in Shenzhen or Guangzhou, before pursuing a law degree and graduate studies in the U.S., Hong Kong or London. "Study abroad is a great opportunity to travel, but if you only travel, you miss out on a lot," he says. "You'll just get a surface-level understanding of a lot of places, and I personally feel a deeper understanding of a few places is a more valuable experience."`
