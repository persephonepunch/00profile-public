`Childhood dream meets real-world immersion MIB graduate transforming her longtime passion for Mandarin culture into a multinational career      Master of International Business candidate Ella Hammond,'25, has spent her time at the Darla Moore School of Business building a bridge between language, culture and global strategy. What began as a seventh-grade interest in Mandarin Chinese grew into an academic path that took her across East Asia and ultimately shaped her vision for a global career.      Hammond says that when she began applying to colleges, she was "looking for a way to connect language learning, business education and learning about global markets." "When I saw that USC had the No. 1 international business program in the nation, everything came together," she says. "Then I discovered the International Business Chinese Enterprise (IBCE) program, and I knew I had to apply."      The IBCE program offered exactly what she was looking for – getting to spend semesters abroad in both Taipei and Hong Kong. "Once I was accepted, committing to the program was a no-brainer," she says.      Hammond entered USC with another major goal of graduating early. She started planning during her freshman year, meeting with her advisor to map out a three-year course schedule. That conversation introduced her to the Accelerated Master of International Business pathway, which would allow her to take graduate courses during her undergraduate studies and complete her Master of International Business in just one additional semester. "Hearing it was possible to finish both degrees in three and a half years aligned perfectly with my goals," she says. "But it also gave me the chance to keep developing my passion for global business."      Hammond's semesters abroad became the defining experiences of her time at USC. In Taipei, she immersed herself in Mandarin while exploring a culture that blends centuries-old Chinese heritage with cutting-edge innovation. Living in Taiwan during a period of heightened geopolitical tension gave her a deeper perspective on resilience, identity and global perception. "Seeing values, traditions and peoples criticized by the Chinese media and misunderstood by the Western media, thrive unapologetically on a daily basis was truly humbling and beautiful," she says. "It made me gain a whole new perspective on the local community."      Hammond's semester at The Chinese University of Hong Kong strengthened her business foundation. Coursework in localized marketing, financial valuation, sustainability and legal systems sharpened her understanding of how markets operate across borders. She says her greatest lessons came from the people she met. "Living in an international dorm gave me friendships with students from every continent," she says. "Hearing their stories – from growing up in Macau to working in Morocco – expanded my global perspective more than anything else."      After graduation, Hammond will move to Denver, where she has accepted a position with British Aerospace Systems working in Program Control Finance for the company's Space and Mission Systems business segment. Her long-term goal is to continue building expertise in aerospace and defense, particularly in government contracting, project finance and international capability development for allied nations. She says she is also considering enrolling in a Ph.D. program that focuses on global markets, political economy and cross-border business strategy.   `
