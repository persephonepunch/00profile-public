`A 'strategic approach to understanding international organizations and markets' Graduate's global journey from the Moore School to the Middle East      For Camille Mueller, '25, economics and international business, the Darla Moore School of Business offered more than a degree — it opened the door to a global education shaped by cultural immersion, academic rigor and meaningful growth. Drawn by the school's top-ranked international business program and global focus, Mueller found a home where she could merge her academic interests with her passion for culture and connection. "I knew from the beginning of my college search that I wanted a university that would challenge me to think beyond my own borders," she says. "The Moore School's global partnerships and study abroad opportunities aligned perfectly with my desire to explore new perspectives and cultures while building a strong foundation in business."      That global curiosity led Mueller to pursue the IBMENA (International Business Middle East and North Africa) program — a year-long academic exchange based in Cairo. There, she immersed herself in the language, culture and economic landscape of a region experiencing rapid transformation. "The Middle East and North Africa had fascinated me for a long time," she says. "The IBMENA program allowed me to explore emerging markets, regional development and cross-cultural management in depth."      While she traveled briefly to Europe, Mueller emphasizes that the heart of her year abroad was spent within Egypt — experiencing the country far beyond Cairo's city center. She visited Alexandria for Eid al-Adha, explored Ain Sokhna, spent nights in the Black and White Deserts, and throughout the year traveled to Hurghada, Siwa, Dahab, Luxor, Aswan and Fayoum. She also climbed Mt. Sinai, an experience she describes as especially meaningful for her personal growth.      Her time in Egypt reshaped the way she viewed culture, communication and global business. "Living and studying in Egypt taught me adaptability, cultural awareness and open-mindedness," she says. "It challenged me to communicate across language and cultural barriers and approach unfamiliar situations with curiosity rather than hesitation."      Mueller's experiences abroad also strengthened her independence and confidence in new environments. "Every semester I came back to Egypt brought me deeper into understanding the culture," she says. "Through building relationships with locals and my classmates, I was able to become more comfortable in my surroundings."      These experiences shaped her long-term goals and inspired her to continue her studies through the Accelerated Master of International Business (MIB) program. "The MIB program builds on the foundation I developed as an undergraduate and takes a more strategic approach to understanding international organizations and markets," she says. "It's the perfect next step toward my long-term goals."      Through her studies, travels and year-long immersion in Egypt, Camille Mueller has embodied the Moore School's mission of developing globally minded, adaptable leaders. Whether in classrooms in Columbia or climbing Mt. Sinai at sunrise, she has embraced every opportunity to learn, connect and grow — proof that her education extends far beyond the walls of the university.`
