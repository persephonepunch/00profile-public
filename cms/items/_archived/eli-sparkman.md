`Balancing the classroom and the court Gamecock athlete balances rigorous courses and D1 basketball with enriching study abroad experience      From the basketball court to international classrooms, Eli Sparkman '25 finance and international business, has made the most of every opportunity the Darla Moore School of Business has to offer — combining athletic discipline, academic excellence and a passion for global business.      Sparkman was drawn to the Moore School's top-ranked international business program for its global focus and career preparation. "I always had aspirations of living abroad after graduating," Sparkman says. "The international business program provides students with the education and resources to be successful wherever they want to go. Whether it's study abroad experiences, professional development or classes tailored to your career interests, the Moore School truly has something for everyone."      Those opportunities came to life during his semester abroad in Santiago, Chile, where Sparkman immersed himself in a new culture and gained a deeper understanding of global perspectives. "My advisor was helpful throughout the entire process," he says. "We had sessions about culture shock and adapting to a new way of life, and the cultural understanding I gained from my classes made the experience even more meaningful."      As a Division I basketball player, Sparkman also learned lessons in teamwork, resilience and time management that translated directly into his success in the classroom. "Playing basketball at this level is demanding, but it's taught me to manage my time and resources effectively," he says. "Balancing academics and athletics isn't always easy, but it's been an incredibly rewarding experience."      After completing his undergraduate degree, Sparkman is continuing his studies through the Accelerated Master of International Business program, further preparing for a career that will take him across borders and industries. "I loved my undergraduate international business classes and experiences," he says. "After my semester in Chile, I knew I wanted to live and work abroad, and the MIB program is helping me take that next step."      From balancing Division I athletics to studying abroad and pursuing graduate-level coursework, Eli Sparkman's journey embodies the Built @ Moore School spirit — one defined by ambition, adaptability and a global vision for the future.`
