Why did you choose to attend USC and the Moore School?
------------------------------------------------------

I chose USC and the Moore School because of its leadership in international business, as well as the unique opportunity to participate in the IBEA Cohort program, gaining first-hand experience in three of the most important regions for global trade in the world. It felt like the perfect way to connect my lifelong interest in history and geopolitics with hands-on business experience.

What activities have you been involved in at the Darla Moore School of Business?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of my involvement with the Moore School has centered around the IBEA program, which I can confidently say was the most transformative experience in my life both intellectually and personally. Being a part of the cohort gave me the opportunity to study and work alongside students from around the world while completing live-client consulting projects across Germany, Singapore and Brazil. Through the program, I've built lifelong friendships across the globe, gained a deeper understanding of global business, and developed a truly global perspective.

Why did you specifically choose the Master of International Business?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I chose to pursue the MIB program because it allowed me to build upon both my professional consulting experience and recent global exposure while developing specialized skills through the Global Strategy track. Through my undergraduate experience, I had seen the many complexities of international business first-hand, ranging from regulatory challenges, geopolitical tensions and cultural barriers, and the MIB program would help me to continue to develop the skills I need to succeed in this increasingly complex and shifting global environment.

What skills did you learn in the MIB program?
---------------------------------------------

The MIB program has given me a blend of analytical, strategic and cross-cultural skills that I know will stay with me throughout my career. I've learned how to approach complex business challenges through a global lens, combining data-driven analysis with an understanding of how culture, politics and economics shape decisions. The program strengthened my ability to lead multicultural teams, communicate across borders and think critically about how global markets are connected. It also pushed me to become more adaptable, curious and confident navigating the increasingly complex world of global business today.

How has your engagement at the Moore School shaped your perspective on business, teamwork, or leadership?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My time at the Moore School has completely reshaped how I view business as a whole. I've learned to see business as a deeply interconnected system rather than something confined to one country or market. Every class, project and team experience has reinforced how culture, communication and collaboration shape strategic decisions. Working with classmates from around the world taught me to listen more carefully, adapt my leadership style and approach problems with a global mindset. The Moore School helped me understand that effective business leadership in today's world means being able to connect across cultures, build mutual understanding and create solutions that work on a global scale.

How have your study abroad experiences through the University of South Carolina in Germany, Singapore and Brazil influenced your learning experience?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Studying in Germany, Singapore and Brazil gave me a truly global education. Each location offered a unique perspective on how a region's economic, political and cultural environment shape business strategy. These experiences challenged me to adapt quickly, think globally and communicate across cultures – skills that have become central to how I approach problem-solving and leadership today.

What was it like volunteering at the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, and how did this experience influence your perspective on global business and international relations?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Volunteering at the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro was one of the most inspiring experiences of my academic journey. As someone who has always been passionate about world history, global issues and geopolitics, being able to contribute to such an important event and be in the presence of the world's most influential leaders as they collaborate on critical global issues was a surreal experience that served to greatly deepen my passion for international business. Being able to experience an environment like the G20 first-hand gave me a deeper appreciation for how interconnected global business and diplomacy truly are. I saw how decisions made in one room can influence markets and communities across the world. It reminded me that effective leadership, whether in government or business, requires understanding the broader systems we operate in and the importance of collaboration in addressing shared global challenges.

What career path are you pursuing after graduation, and how has the Moore School prepared you to succeed in that field?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am currently pursuing a career in management consulting. I had the opportunity to complete several live-client consulting projects both through the IBEA program and the MIB during my time at the Moore School which gave me hands-on experience working in the field across different countries.

What are your future career goals?
----------------------------------

I hope to continue to develop through a career in management consulting/corporate strategy. I want to build a career focusing on the intersection of international business, global strategy and geopolitics, analyzing how global markets, trade and policy shape business decisions.
