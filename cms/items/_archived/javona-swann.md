`Balancing company priorities with the needs of its people MHR candidate ready to begin career with IBM      Master of Human Resources graduate Javona Swann, '25, says her journey to the University of South Carolina was guided by faith, purpose and timing. "The answer to why I chose USC and the Moore School is simple," Swann says. "I felt led to come here by the Lord."      At the time, she was working with Morgan Stanley in a good job that offered stability but not a clear path toward future growth or personal development. Then, in what she describes as a moment of divine direction, she found herself searching online for information about the Moore School's Master of Human Resources program. "I called and got more information from the program advisor, applied within a week and was admitted the next day," she recalls. "Now that I'm here, I'm so grateful. I feel like this was the right place for me to be at the right time."      From her first semester, Swann says she admired the program's rigor, professionalism and sense of community. "All of the faculty are extremely knowledgeable and genuinely care about students both inside and outside of the classroom," she says. "We meet top HR executives on a weekly and sometimes daily basis – a one-of-a-kind experience that I don't believe is offered at any other program."      This consistent exposure to industry leaders has shaped Swann into not just an HR professional but a future business leader.      Before joining the Moore School, Swann worked in talent development and program management – experiences that brought a real-world perspective to her coursework. "Having work experience gave me a pulse on the real-world issues that employees and HR practitioners were experiencing," she says. "I was able to share that with my cohort. My previous roles helped add richness to my time in the classroom."      Through both her prior experience and her time in the program, Swann has developed a powerful understanding of leadership and teamwork. "This program definitely prepares you for corporate life," she says. "You work in teams you don't choose and must depend on one another all semester. It teaches you how to recognize strengths in others, have difficult conversations, be vulnerable and forgive quickly."      For Swann, great leadership is rooted in empathy and discretion. "To be successful in HR, you have to balance the priorities of the company with the needs of its people," she explains. "You're often speaking with individuals about the most personal parts of their lives – from compensation and family planning to how valued they feel in the workplace."      Her advice for future HR professionals is both practical and heartfelt: "Learn the business and its strategic objectives, care about the people you work for, speak up and make recommendations that serve both the organization and the people. And above all to take care of yourself so you can show up well for others."      This January, Swann will take the next step in her career by moving to New York to begin her role as a compensation specialist at IBM.`
