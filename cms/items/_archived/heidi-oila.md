`Combining law and global strategy From Finland to South Carolina, MIB student Heidi Oila building a career that crosses continents and cultures      Master of International Business graduate Heidi Oila, '25, says pursuing her graduate studies at the Moore School has been an opportunity to broaden her academic and professional horizons across continents. "I wanted to gain international experience in addition to my law degree in Finland, and I was drawn to the strong reputation of the Moore School, especially in international business," Oila says. "The Moore School stood out because of its global perspective and collaborative, multicultural environment."      Oila, who is pursuing a double degree through a partnership between the University of South Carolina and Aalto University School of Business in Finland, says the program has given her a front-row seat to "how businesses operate across borders".      During her time at the Moore School, Oila has participated in networking events, international student gatherings and speaker series featuring executives from multinational firms. These experiences, she says, "have offered valuable insights into global leadership, sustainability and how large organizations navigate international markets."      Comparing her experiences at Aalto and the Moore School, Oila notes that while both universities share a commitment to academic excellence, their teaching styles differ. "Aalto is slightly more research-oriented and analytical, while the Moore School offers a more interactive and experiential learning environment that emphasizes teamwork and real-world application," she says.      Through the MIB program, Oila has strengthened her cross-cultural teamwork, strategic decision-making and communication skills, while also improving her English through group projects and presentations.      Before joining the MIB program, Oila earned a Master of Laws degree in Finland. Oila's "ultimate goal is to combine my knowledge of law and business and pursue an international career that connects both fields", she says. "The MIB program has strengthened my understanding of global markets and taught me how to approach business challenges from an international perspective."      As she prepares to return to Aalto University to complete her studies and thesis, Oila reflects on her time at the Moore School as a period of tremendous growth. "This experience has taught me the ability to work effectively in cross-cultural teams and adapt communication and management styles to different cultures," she says.`
