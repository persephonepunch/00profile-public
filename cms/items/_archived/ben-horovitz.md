`First-generation dual-citizen graduate fast-tracking a global operations future Ambitious Moore School student deepens cultural understanding while building vital hard skills      Graduating in just two and a half years with a degree in operations and supply chain, Benedek Horovitz, '25, has combined discipline, global experience and technical skills to build an impressive early career foundation — one that's already opening doors in health care operations. Fluent in English, Hungarian and Spanish, Horovitz recognized from the outset that the Moore School would be the ideal fit. "The number-one-ranked international business program definitely caught my attention because I've always loved traveling and learning about other cultures and languages," he says. "I wanted to go somewhere that felt global but also practical — and the Moore School really delivered on both."      Horovitz entered college with 52 credits earned through Advanced Placement and dual-enrollment classes, allowing him to pursue an accelerated path and complete his degree in record time. After his first operations and supply chain course, he discovered his passion. "I didn't go into college planning to study supply chain, but after one lecture in assistant professor Blair Flicker's class, everything clicked," he says. "It combined data, problem-solving and real impact — and I loved that."      A first-generation Hungarian American dual citizen, Horovitz spent the summer working in Budapest, returning to his cultural roots while gaining hands-on professional experience. There, he worked with a developer to build a web app that streamlined operations for a food delivery company that replaced its paper prep system. He continued working remotely during the semester, applying what he learned to real-world operations. "Budapest will always be my motherland," he says. "Growing up between two cultures made me flexible and curious. That adaptability has helped me academically and professionally — it's one of my most valuable skills."      That adaptability served him well during his supply chain internship at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, where he was selected from nearly 600 applicants. He built tools and dashboards that streamlined systems and improved efficiency across departments. "It was one of those moments where everything I learned at the Moore School came to life," he says. "It showed me how much impact good operations can have in health care."      After graduation, Horovitz will return to Northwestern Medicine as a performance engineer — MMIS (Materials Management Information Systems), starting in January. In this role, he'll focus on continuous improvement projects and building dashboards and applications that support supply chain operations across the system.      Every place Horovitz has called home — from Myrtle Beach to Budapest to Chicago — has shaped the adaptable, driven person he's become. As he closes one chapter at the Moore School and begins another at Northwestern Medicine, he carries forward not only lessons in data and efficiency but also in gratitude and growth.`
