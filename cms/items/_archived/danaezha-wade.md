How USC changed my life:
------------------------

The Master of Human Resources program at the Darla Moore School of Business has made a tremendous impact on me. I entered the program with only minor knowledge of the field, and now I approach graduation with an enlarged passion for how HR acts as the intersection between people and the business. I have also seen my confidence grow over the last year as I took on leadership positions and challenged myself to speak up in the classroom. Additionally, I have made lifelong connections through this program that I will leverage professionally and personally.

A favorite memory:
------------------

One of my favorite memories while enrolled at USC was my study abroad experience in Singapore. I spent a week in Singapore alongside 20 classmates and two professors. Not only did I immerse myself in a culture that is different from my own, but I also got the chance to witness international business culture.

Advice for incoming students:
-----------------------------

My advice to incoming students is to make as many connections as possible, including professors, classmates and companies that visit campus. You never know how someone may be able to support you years down the road, as well as how you can be a valuable resource to others.

What I've learned about myself:
-------------------------------

I learned that while I am typically a "Type A" individual or a "perfectionist," it is okay to make mistakes or ask for help along the way. I found myself producing better work and thinking more strategically as I collaborated with other students on class assignments and special projects. My willingness to be either a leader or a team player is a transferable skill that I will take with me as I begin my career.

What played a role in my success:
---------------------------------

Professor Julian Dalzell played a pivotal role in my development through the MHR program. He challenged me to think about my life and career with a global lens. This led me to pursue an internship and career with an international Fortune 100 company, as well as enroll in a study abroad course during my time at USC. Professor Dalzell never hesitated to have authentic conversations and give well-thought-out advice to me throughout the program, all of which I will hold on to preciously as I begin my career.

What's next:
------------

Following graduation, I will relocate to Lake County, Illinois, to begin my full-time career at AbbVie as a Human Resources Leadership Development Program (HRLDP) participant.
