`Building 'a career as an advocate for employees' MHR candidate solidifies hard and soft skills while growing her passion for HR      Master of Human Resources graduate Erin Mazza, '25, is ready to start her HR career with a secured job with Honeywell. Completing a third internship while enrolled in the MHR program led to a highly competitive spot in Honeywell's leadership development program. The Moore School's MHR program is known for providing pivotal internships with top employers that often produce full-time job offers like Mazza's.      This reputation is what led her to the Moore School. Drawn by the opportunity to "learn from world-renowned faculty, connect with strategic business partners, and gain hands-on experience both inside and outside the classroom," Mazza says she knew the Moore School would prepare her for success.      With an academic background in psychology and political science and a strong interest in the law, Mazza found that human resources perfectly united her passions for people and policy. "Human resources allows me to marry my two passions – the law and people – and build a career as an advocate for employees while ensuring that we're all driving forward the bottom line," she says.      Throughout her time in the MHR program, Mazza has developed a diverse set of hard and soft skills that will serve her throughout her career. She especially values the lessons she's learned about "dealing with ambiguity, networking effectively, and understanding how businesses operate and generate value," she says.      Her professional journey has been enriched by three impactful HR internships – at Clemson University, Fox Corporation and Honeywell. Each experience offered a unique perspective on the field. At Clemson, she confirmed her passion for HR. At Fox, she gained valuable corporate HR experience, exploring functions like recruitment, learning and development, benefits, and culture. At Honeywell, she gained a deeper understanding of the strategic role HR plays within an organization – one that drives business success while supporting employees.      In addition to her internships, Mazza served as a graduate assistant for the MHR program at the Moore School, where she contributed to various projects and events. One of her favorite responsibilities was recruiting for the MHR class of 2026. "My goal with this GA job was to leave the MHR program better than I found it," she shares. "I truly hope that is the legacy I am leaving behind as I graduate."      Inspired by her hardworking parents – her mother was a vice president of an organization herself – Mazza aspires to one day become "vice president of human resources at an organization where I am valued and where my voice matters," she says.      After graduation, Mazza will join Honeywell in Charlotte, North Carolina, as an HR generalist in the company's future HR leaders development program. Her journey at the Moore School has equipped her with the knowledge, confidence and leadership skills to make an immediate impact in the field of human resources and beyond.`
