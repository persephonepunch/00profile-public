`From launching a service organization to exploring the world of AI research Accounting graduate benefits from a well-rounded learning experience      Megan Monaghan, '25 accounting and '26 MACC candidate, has experienced college as a journey of connection, leadership and discovery. Currently enrolled in the Moore School's Accelerated Master of Accountancy program, she says she has shaped her time at USC through service, involvement and academic curiosity.      While strengthening her technical skills, Monaghan has also been deeply involved in the Women in Business student organization. "I have been a part of Women in Business where I also briefly served on the 'WIBternship' Committee," she says. "On this committee, I helped run new member meetings, conducted mock interviews and was one of the judges for the new members' case competition."      One of her proudest accomplishments is co-founding Carolina's Compassionate Connections. The organization partners with Epworth Children's Home to support local youth through service, donations and community events. "I am most proud of founding Carolina's Compassionate Connections during my sophomore year," she says. "Leading this club has given me the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in the Columbia community while building lasting connections with inspiring people."      Along with service-related activities, Monaghan also grew globally through the Business Culture in Greece Maymester course. "This rewarding experience allowed me to understand the integration of tradition and globalization in Greece," she says. "It was not only rewarding witnessing the culture but also the connections I was able to make." She describes the program as one of her favorite college memories.      Returning from abroad, her global learning experiences complemented her academic interests. "ACCT 225 was the class that first made me realize how interested I was in accounting," she explained. She says the course showed her how problem-solving and analysis come together in the field, inspiring her to pursue accounting as her major.      Her SC Honors College thesis reflects that same curiosity. "Human vs. AI: A Study of Influencer Credibility and Effectiveness in Social Media Marketing" explores how consumers respond to artificial intelligence influencers. "This thesis has shown me how AI is shaping our world," she says. "I was able to see how much AI is continuing to adapt."      Looking back, Monaghan is grateful for the lessons learned at the Moore School. "Collaboration and adaptability are just as important as technical knowledge," she says. "Group projects and real-world problem-solving helped me grow as a teammate and leader."      Drawing from her experiences, she encourages others: "Don't stress so much and try to get involved as much as possible. The Moore School offers so many opportunities."      After finishing her MACC degree this summer, Megan will begin her career in New York as a private client services associate at Andersen, a financial services company.   `
