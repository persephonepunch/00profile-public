`Gaining a passion for accounting Graduate immerses herself in opportunities for leadership and career readiness      Accounting graduate Lauren Canto '25, chose USC because of the Moore School's harmonious combination of being challenging and fostering community. "During my college search, I knew I wanted to go to school in the South," she says. "Academics have always been a top priority for me, so finding a university with a competitive and prestigious business school was essential. After touring USC and researching the Moore School, I knew I would love it here."      Canto's passion for accounting began her senior year of high school when an introductory class with one of her favorite teachers opened her eyes to the profession's possibilities. "I enjoyed exploring the various career paths within the field, such as forensic accounting," she says. "My goal is to work at a public accounting firm, but knowing I have flexibility and options within the field is something I really value."      Throughout her time at the Moore School, Canto immersed herself in campus life and leadership. She has been an active member of Beta Alpha Psi, the American Marketing Association and the Accounting Scholars Program and she also served as a University 101 Peer Leader for two years. "Beta Alpha Psi strengthened my professional skills and helped me better understand the accounting field," she says. "AMA encouraged my creativity and teamwork, and Accounting Scholars deepened my understanding of public accounting while connecting me with PwC."      Her role as a University 101 Peer Leader became one of her most meaningful experiences. "It's been an honor to guide first-year students who were a lot like me a few years ago," she says. "That experience strengthened my leadership, communication and public-speaking skills and reminded me how dedicated our professors and advisors are to student success."      Canto admits that balancing her academics, leadership roles and social life was a challenge — but also one of her greatest lessons. "It pushed me to develop strong time-management and prioritization skills," she says. "I learned how capable and resilient I am when faced with multiple demanding responsibilities."      Looking ahead, Canto will complete her Master of Accountancy in summer 2026 and has a summer internship with PwC. She also has a job offer from Forvis Mazars, where she interned last summer, and plans to complete all four sections of the CPA exam before starting full-time work in 2027. Her long-term goal is to become an audit partner at a public accounting firm, where she can mentor others and contribute to strategic financial decisions. "The Moore School has given me both the technical foundation and the soft skills I need to be successful," she says. "More importantly, it's connected me with mentors and professionals who've guided me along the way."      Her advice for future students is simple but powerful: "Connect with your professors early," she says. "They truly want the best for you and can help shape your path in ways you might not expect."      As she reflects on her journey, Canto is grateful for the opportunities and challenges that shaped her. "The Moore School has challenged me, inspired me, and helped me discover who I want to be as a professional," she says. "I'm so thankful for every experience that's made me who I am today."      -Amelia Douglas`
