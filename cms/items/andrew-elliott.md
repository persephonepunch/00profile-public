`Fourth-generation Gamecock reflects on growth and gratitude Accounting faculty inspire graduate to follow in his parents' footsteps      Accounting graduate Andrew Elliott, '25, wavered on his decision to enroll in the Moore School and USC but is grateful for his decision and for all the ways he's grown as a person. Noting his "entire family has been to USC," Elliott says choosing the University of South Carolina felt both familiar and unexpectedly right. Growing up in Columbia, he considered leaving home for college but found himself drawn back after touring campus.      Within his family, there are 18 degrees in math or accounting, and both his parents are accountants. "Ironically, growing up, I always said I never wanted to do what my dad does," Elliott says. The Moore School also offered a natural fit. "I really enjoyed my tour and the opportunity to be close to my mom," he says. "Getting home-cooked meals every month has been a great pick-me-up when I needed it."      He enrolled as a finance major with no plans to follow in his parents' footsteps. But an introductory course quickly changed his mind. "My ACCT 225 class completely changed the trajectory of my time here," he says. "I loved accounting. In many ways, it's like a big puzzle."      Accounting professors such as Shannon McCutchen and Bryan Stikeleather played important roles in shaping his academic experience. "Even though I hate managerial accounting, I looked forward to walking into Stikeleather's class every day," Elliott says. Stikeleather's managerial class confirmed that Elliott was pursuing the right career path, giving him confidence and excitement about the world of accounting.      While Elliott didn't join formal Moore School organizations, he found leadership opportunities and community involvement through his church, serving as a Life Group leader and on the student exec team for the college ministry. "These opportunities taught me a ton about working as part of a team," he says. "They provided tangible skills that have translated to success in my schoolwork and relationships. Social skills matter, caring about people on a human level matters, and building genuine relationships makes all the difference."      More than any single accomplishment, Elliott is proud of the person he has become during his time at USC. "I came into college as a very immature kid," he says. "I like to think I'm leaving much wiser and humbler." Learning to study, manage challenges and develop discipline has shaped both his academic journey and personal growth.      He has also learned that success is broader than grades or technical expertise. "There's a lot more to a career than raw book smarts," he says. "Everyone has value and brings something to the table." Recognizing strengths of both his own and those of others has helped him build relationships and confidence.      After graduation, Elliott will return to Elliott Davis in Columbia for a tax internship before studying for the CPA and returning to the Moore School for the Master of Accountancy program. With another graduation on the horizon in 2027, he is eager for what's ahead. "I can't wait to see how I learn and grow along the way," he says.`
