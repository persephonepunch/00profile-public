`Adapting 'quickly and approach challenges with curiosity' International business cohort graduate prepares for a career in global corporate law      As graduation approaches, Macaria Cheatham, '25 finance and international business, says she is grateful she chose to enroll in the International Business and Chinese Enterprise (IBCE) Cohort program, which allowed her to study for a year in Hong Kong and spend a summer in Taiwan. "When I first learned about the IBCE program, it felt like the perfect fit," Cheatham says. "I took three years of language classes and now I'm on my third year of Chinese culture courses. Academically and professionally, it's expanded my cultural knowledge and solidified my interest in working with international companies."      Living abroad also pushed Cheatham to grow in new ways. "One of the most valuable lessons I took away from living in Hong Kong and Taiwan is independence," she says. "Being 14 hours ahead of my family in Utah meant I couldn't always rely on them — I had to figure things out on my own. Those experiences taught me how to adapt quickly and approach challenges with curiosity."      Back on campus, Cheatham continued to broaden her global understanding through the Accelerated Master of International Business program, international guest lectures and collaboration with students from across the world. "The Moore School has continuously encouraged global engagement — from fireside chats to courses with exchange students," she says. "Through these opportunities, my perspective on business and culture has expanded enormously."      Alongside her international business-related activities, Cheatham joined the Women in Business Council as a freshman and later joined Sigma Omega Upsilon (SOU), an international business fraternity that gave her opportunities to lead and mentor others. "Since being in SOU, I've held positions as professional chair and Sigma education chair," she says. "Helping new members through our Personal Development Program has been incredibly rewarding."      Along with the skills she gained with her extracurricular involvement, Cheatham's time abroad and in the classroom has inspired her next goal: pursuing global corporate law. "I realized I could combine my interests in law and international business," she says. "Global corporate law allows me to use my business and financial background while working across borders — it feels perfectly tailored to me."      She plans to take a year to complete another master's program abroad before applying to law schools in major U.S. cities like Boston, Seattle and New York, with the long-term goal of working in international corporate law. "The advice I'd give anyone pursuing a similar path is to be confident in yourself," Cheatham says. "Law is demanding, and the process can be uncertain — but believing in your abilities and connecting with mentors will take you farther than you think."      From Utah to Columbia to Hong Kong and beyond, Macaria Cheatham's journey embodies the Moore School's mission — to shape curious, globally minded leaders ready to navigate the world with confidence and purpose.`
