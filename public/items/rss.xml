            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;From launching a service organization to exploring the world of AI research Accounting graduate benefits from a well-rounded learning experience      Megan Monaghan, &#39;25 accounting and &#39;26 MACC candidate, has experienced college as a journey of connection, leadership and discovery. Currently enrolled in the Moore School&#39;s Accelerated Master of Accountancy program, she says she has shaped her time at USC through service, involvement and academic curiosity.      While strengthening her technical skills, Monaghan has also been deeply involved in the Women in Business student organization. &amp;quot;I have been a part of Women in Business where I also briefly served on the &#39;WIBternship&#39; Committee,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;On this committee, I helped run new member meetings, conducted mock interviews and was one of the judges for the new members&#39; case competition.&amp;quot;      One of her proudest accomplishments is co-founding Carolina&#39;s Compassionate Connections. The organization partners with Epworth Children&#39;s Home to support local youth through service, donations and community events. &amp;quot;I am most proud of founding Carolina&#39;s Compassionate Connections during my sophomore year,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Leading this club has given me the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in the Columbia community while building lasting connections with inspiring people.&amp;quot;      Along with service-related activities, Monaghan also grew globally through the Business Culture in Greece Maymester course. &amp;quot;This rewarding experience allowed me to understand the integration of tradition and globalization in Greece,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;It was not only rewarding witnessing the culture but also the connections I was able to make.&amp;quot; She describes the program as one of her favorite college memories.      Returning from abroad, her global learning experiences complemented her academic interests. &amp;quot;ACCT 225 was the class that first made me realize how interested I was in accounting,&amp;quot; she explained. She says the course showed her how problem-solving and analysis come together in the field, inspiring her to pursue accounting as her major.      Her SC Honors College thesis reflects that same curiosity. &amp;quot;Human vs. AI: A Study of Influencer Credibility and Effectiveness in Social Media Marketing&amp;quot; explores how consumers respond to artificial intelligence influencers. &amp;quot;This thesis has shown me how AI is shaping our world,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I was able to see how much AI is continuing to adapt.&amp;quot;      Looking back, Monaghan is grateful for the lessons learned at the Moore School. &amp;quot;Collaboration and adaptability are just as important as technical knowledge,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Group projects and real-world problem-solving helped me grow as a teammate and leader.&amp;quot;      Drawing from her experiences, she encourages others: &amp;quot;Don&#39;t stress so much and try to get involved as much as possible. The Moore School offers so many opportunities.&amp;quot;      After finishing her MACC degree this summer, Megan will begin her career in New York as a private client services associate at Andersen, a financial services company.   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Combining law and global strategy From Finland to South Carolina, MIB student Heidi Oila building a career that crosses continents and cultures      Master of International Business graduate Heidi Oila, &#39;25, says pursuing her graduate studies at the Moore School has been an opportunity to broaden her academic and professional horizons across continents. &amp;quot;I wanted to gain international experience in addition to my law degree in Finland, and I was drawn to the strong reputation of the Moore School, especially in international business,&amp;quot; Oila says. &amp;quot;The Moore School stood out because of its global perspective and collaborative, multicultural environment.&amp;quot;      Oila, who is pursuing a double degree through a partnership between the University of South Carolina and Aalto University School of Business in Finland, says the program has given her a front-row seat to &amp;quot;how businesses operate across borders&amp;quot;.      During her time at the Moore School, Oila has participated in networking events, international student gatherings and speaker series featuring executives from multinational firms. These experiences, she says, &amp;quot;have offered valuable insights into global leadership, sustainability and how large organizations navigate international markets.&amp;quot;      Comparing her experiences at Aalto and the Moore School, Oila notes that while both universities share a commitment to academic excellence, their teaching styles differ. &amp;quot;Aalto is slightly more research-oriented and analytical, while the Moore School offers a more interactive and experiential learning environment that emphasizes teamwork and real-world application,&amp;quot; she says.      Through the MIB program, Oila has strengthened her cross-cultural teamwork, strategic decision-making and communication skills, while also improving her English through group projects and presentations.      Before joining the MIB program, Oila earned a Master of Laws degree in Finland. Oila&#39;s &amp;quot;ultimate goal is to combine my knowledge of law and business and pursue an international career that connects both fields&amp;quot;, she says. &amp;quot;The MIB program has strengthened my understanding of global markets and taught me how to approach business challenges from an international perspective.&amp;quot;      As she prepares to return to Aalto University to complete her studies and thesis, Oila reflects on her time at the Moore School as a period of tremendous growth. &amp;quot;This experience has taught me the ability to work effectively in cross-cultural teams and adapt communication and management styles to different cultures,&amp;quot; she says.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Building &#39;a career as an advocate for employees&#39; MHR candidate solidifies hard and soft skills while growing her passion for HR      Master of Human Resources graduate Erin Mazza, &#39;25, is ready to start her HR career with a secured job with Honeywell. Completing a third internship while enrolled in the MHR program led to a highly competitive spot in Honeywell&#39;s leadership development program. The Moore School&#39;s MHR program is known for providing pivotal internships with top employers that often produce full-time job offers like Mazza&#39;s.      This reputation is what led her to the Moore School. Drawn by the opportunity to &amp;quot;learn from world-renowned faculty, connect with strategic business partners, and gain hands-on experience both inside and outside the classroom,&amp;quot; Mazza says she knew the Moore School would prepare her for success.      With an academic background in psychology and political science and a strong interest in the law, Mazza found that human resources perfectly united her passions for people and policy. &amp;quot;Human resources allows me to marry my two passions – the law and people – and build a career as an advocate for employees while ensuring that we&#39;re all driving forward the bottom line,&amp;quot; she says.      Throughout her time in the MHR program, Mazza has developed a diverse set of hard and soft skills that will serve her throughout her career. She especially values the lessons she&#39;s learned about &amp;quot;dealing with ambiguity, networking effectively, and understanding how businesses operate and generate value,&amp;quot; she says.      Her professional journey has been enriched by three impactful HR internships – at Clemson University, Fox Corporation and Honeywell. Each experience offered a unique perspective on the field. At Clemson, she confirmed her passion for HR. At Fox, she gained valuable corporate HR experience, exploring functions like recruitment, learning and development, benefits, and culture. At Honeywell, she gained a deeper understanding of the strategic role HR plays within an organization – one that drives business success while supporting employees.      In addition to her internships, Mazza served as a graduate assistant for the MHR program at the Moore School, where she contributed to various projects and events. One of her favorite responsibilities was recruiting for the MHR class of 2026. &amp;quot;My goal with this GA job was to leave the MHR program better than I found it,&amp;quot; she shares. &amp;quot;I truly hope that is the legacy I am leaving behind as I graduate.&amp;quot;      Inspired by her hardworking parents – her mother was a vice president of an organization herself – Mazza aspires to one day become &amp;quot;vice president of human resources at an organization where I am valued and where my voice matters,&amp;quot; she says.      After graduation, Mazza will join Honeywell in Charlotte, North Carolina, as an HR generalist in the company&#39;s future HR leaders development program. Her journey at the Moore School has equipped her with the knowledge, confidence and leadership skills to make an immediate impact in the field of human resources and beyond.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Learning &#39;cross-cultural communication, teamwork and tenacity&#39; Graduate gets to live his passion in Asia through multiple experiences      For Parker Shea, &#39;25 economics and international business, the Darla Moore School of Business offered a way to turn his curiosity about the world into a career. &amp;quot;The International Business and Chinese Enterprise (IBCE) cohort immediately stood out to me,&amp;quot; Shea says. &amp;quot;It offered an experience that went far beyond the classroom — one that connected me directly to Asia and let me study global business from both sides of the world.&amp;quot;      Pairing international business with economics gave Shea a well-rounded foundation for understanding global policy and markets. &amp;quot;Out of the Moore School majors, economics seemed to fit best with my interests,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I&#39;ve really enjoyed the upper-level economics courses I&#39;ve taken at USC — they&#39;ve challenged me to think critically about real-world systems and how global economies operate.&amp;quot;      Beyond academics, Shea found community in Sigma Omega Upsilon, a professional international business fraternity that provided a network of mentors and peers. &amp;quot;Joining SOU my freshman year was one of my best decisions,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;It helped me develop my professional skills and gave me a strong community to come back to after studying abroad.&amp;quot;      That study abroad experience — in both Taiwan and Hong Kong — proved transformative. In Taiwan, Shea lived in the heart of Taipei&#39;s Shida night market, immersing himself in the pace and rhythm of city life. Later, while studying at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, he found himself drawn to urban infrastructure and the city&#39;s remarkable efficiency. &amp;quot;Having lived in Columbia for 19 years, arriving in Taiwan was a major change,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;In Hong Kong, the subway system especially had a big impact on me — it sparked my interest in public policy and urbanism.&amp;quot;      While in Hong Kong, Shea also joined the championship-winning dragon boat team, one of his most memorable experiences abroad. &amp;quot;Dragon boat was absolutely my favorite thing I did in Hong Kong,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I started off as a complete novice but ended up making local friends I still keep in touch with. It taught me cross-cultural communication, teamwork and tenacity — and I even picked up some Cantonese.&amp;quot;      Back in South Carolina, he gained hands-on experience through internships with the South Carolina House of Representatives and SC Economics, applying his classroom lessons to public policy and education initiatives.      After graduation, Shea will teach in China, likely in Shenzhen or Guangzhou, before pursuing a law degree and graduate studies in the U.S., Hong Kong or London. &amp;quot;Study abroad is a great opportunity to travel, but if you only travel, you miss out on a lot,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;You&#39;ll just get a surface-level understanding of a lot of places, and I personally feel a deeper understanding of a few places is a more valuable experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A well-rounded Finance Scholar Finance student takes advantage of programs and builds connections to launch an investment banking career      December graduate Nathan Sageser, &#39;25 accounting and finance, has leveraged his experience as a Finance Scholar and Moore School student to begin his career with a reputable multinational financial services company. Sageser credits the Moore School with providing a variety of in-classroom and real-world scenarios, including developing his own initiative, leadership skills and commitment to building community. &amp;quot;The Moore School offers an incredible range of resources, but it&#39;s up to each student to take advantage of them,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;The most important lesson the Moore School offered me was the importance of owning your own career and taking initiative.&amp;quot;      Sageser&#39;s mindset helped him thrive in one of the Moore School&#39;s most rigorous academic experiences, the Finance Scholars Program. He credits the program&#39;s technical, case-based instruction and powerful alumni network for landing a role in investment banking. &amp;quot;The program offered me specific talking points for interviews and offered excellent practice prior to hitting the trading desk,&amp;quot; Sageser says. &amp;quot;Additionally, the alumni network is incredible. I learned about the bank I ultimately signed with because an alumnus reached out directly to finance professor Gregory Niehaus and asked for our contact information.&amp;quot;      Beyond the classroom, he embraced opportunities to apply his knowledge in competitive and collaborative settings. Competing in more than half a dozen case competitions, he found both challenge and reward in solving real-world business problems under pressure. &amp;quot;Despite how intense they can be, I have always found case competitions very rewarding,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;They were excellent opportunities to learn a lot about a specific industry in a very short period, and they really encouraged me to think creatively about all kinds of business solutions.&amp;quot;      Among his most meaningful accomplishments was co-founding the Freshman Finance Academy alongside fellow Finance Scholar Nick Magnotta. Designed to prepare high-achieving first-year students for elite finance careers, the program includes a seven-week curriculum covering networking, accounting, valuation modeling and more, culminating in a mock sell-side pitch. &amp;quot;This September, the cohort took a trip to Charlotte, North Carolina, where we got the opportunity to visit several top investment banks in person and hear several recruiting presentations,&amp;quot; he explains. &amp;quot;That sort of opportunity is not something the Moore School Department of Finance has had in a long time, so being able to finally go and visit these banks in person and be actively recruited was a super exciting step forward for the Moore School&#39;s undergraduate finance program.&amp;quot;      Key courses and mentors at the Moore School helped shape Sageser&#39;s understanding of finance, turning academic lessons into a career of strategic decision-making and real-world impact. Finance department chair and professor &amp;quot;Eric Powers and his FINA 363: Introduction to Finance class played a large role in my desire to pursue a career in finance. Learning about the very technical nature of finance and how decisions were made in the real world was extremely interesting, and it solidified my desire to pursue that type of work in my profession,&amp;quot; Sageser says.      In addition to FINA 363, Sageser says finance clinical assistant professor Brandon Mendez&#39;s FINA 470: Financial Statement Analysis course was equally thought-provoking. &amp;quot;Mendez&#39;s case-based approach to teaching financial statements and his strong emphasis on strategic decision-making offered a unique perspective,&amp;quot; Sageser says.      Building on the foundation he&#39;s established at the Moore School, Sageser is eager to explore different paths within finance and continue to learn from mentors and peers. Heading to Charlotte as an incoming investment banking analyst at William Blair, &amp;quot;there are countless different potential life and career paths ahead of me, and I&#39;m looking forward to taking the first few years out of college to explore them and decide on what path I want to pursue,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Learning to strategically manage soldiers MHR candidate says &#39;transitioning from leading soldiers to leading organizational change felt like a natural next step&#39;      Master of Human Resources graduate Micah Stavrou, &#39;25, is combining his years of military service with the strategic tools of human resources to lead one of the U.S. Army&#39;s largest combat divisions. &amp;quot;Serving over 13 years in the Army taught me that leadership is ultimately about influence, not authority,&amp;quot; Stavrou says. &amp;quot;Whether leading a platoon overseas or collaborating on a group project, I&#39;ve learned the importance of clarity, accountability and mutual respect.&amp;quot;      Stavrou says his military experience also reinforced the value of diverse teams. &amp;quot;Diverse teams produce the strongest results, a principle that translates directly to the classroom, where each person&#39;s perspective strengthens the outcome,&amp;quot; he says.      Stavrou chose the Moore School&#39;s MHR program to expand his impact beyond the military. &amp;quot;Throughout my career, I saw firsthand how the right people strategy can make or break an organization&#39;s mission,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Transitioning from leading soldiers to leading organizational change felt like a natural next step.&amp;quot;      Building on his military experience, Stavrou sought a program to strengthen his HR skills and gain the strategic tools needed to lead organizations effectively. &amp;quot;The Moore School&#39;s MHR program stood out for its emphasis on analytics, strategy and global HR leadership,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;The professors are world-renowned, and I was able to gain all of the critical skills I wanted to develop to serve beyond the military and continue making an impact through people.&amp;quot;      Among his proudest achievements, Stavrou points to the relationships he&#39;s built with his fellow MHR candidates and professors during the program. &amp;quot;The Moore School community has been incredibly supportive,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Building those connections has been just as meaningful as any academic achievement.&amp;quot;      Stavrou has also been able to bring his military and operational perspective into classroom discussions and consulting projects. &amp;quot;Whether working with IBM, PepsiCo, or other organizations, I&#39;ve translated my experience into practical insights that have driven measurable business outcomes,&amp;quot; Stavrou says.      Two professors, in particular, have shaped his career development. &amp;quot;Professor Patrick Wright had a major influence on how I think about organizational strategy and the role HR plays in driving business performance,&amp;quot; he says. Wright&#39;s &amp;quot;ability to connect people&#39;s decisions to long-term competitive advantage reshaped the way I approach workforce planning and organizational design.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Professor Anthony Nyberg challenged me in a different way. He consistently pushed me to defend my positions, question my assumptions, and articulate why I believe what I believed,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;That level of rigor pushed me to grow not just academically but personally and professionally.&amp;quot;      Along with being challenged in the MHR program, Stavrou says he also appreciates the support he received at home from his wife, Tabitha Phillips, and daughters Phillips, 11, and Micah-Leigh, 9, while he was enrolled.      Looking ahead, Stavrou plans to leverage his MHR experience to drive organizational impact. With his military foundation and business education, he is poised to lead teams, elevate organizations, and continue making a meaningful difference through people-focused leadership.      Following graduation, Stavrou will return to active duty to lead the Force Integration Division with the 1st Cavalry Division in Fort Hood, Texas. This assignment offers him the opportunity to apply the strategic HR and organizational alignment skills he has developed in the MHR program to one of the Army&#39;s largest combat divisions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Gaining a passion for accounting Graduate immerses herself in opportunities for leadership and career readiness      Accounting graduate Lauren Canto &#39;25, chose USC because of the Moore School&#39;s harmonious combination of being challenging and fostering community. &amp;quot;During my college search, I knew I wanted to go to school in the South,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Academics have always been a top priority for me, so finding a university with a competitive and prestigious business school was essential. After touring USC and researching the Moore School, I knew I would love it here.&amp;quot;      Canto&#39;s passion for accounting began her senior year of high school when an introductory class with one of her favorite teachers opened her eyes to the profession&#39;s possibilities. &amp;quot;I enjoyed exploring the various career paths within the field, such as forensic accounting,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;My goal is to work at a public accounting firm, but knowing I have flexibility and options within the field is something I really value.&amp;quot;      Throughout her time at the Moore School, Canto immersed herself in campus life and leadership. She has been an active member of Beta Alpha Psi, the American Marketing Association and the Accounting Scholars Program and she also served as a University 101 Peer Leader for two years. &amp;quot;Beta Alpha Psi strengthened my professional skills and helped me better understand the accounting field,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;AMA encouraged my creativity and teamwork, and Accounting Scholars deepened my understanding of public accounting while connecting me with PwC.&amp;quot;      Her role as a University 101 Peer Leader became one of her most meaningful experiences. &amp;quot;It&#39;s been an honor to guide first-year students who were a lot like me a few years ago,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;That experience strengthened my leadership, communication and public-speaking skills and reminded me how dedicated our professors and advisors are to student success.&amp;quot;      Canto admits that balancing her academics, leadership roles and social life was a challenge — but also one of her greatest lessons. &amp;quot;It pushed me to develop strong time-management and prioritization skills,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I learned how capable and resilient I am when faced with multiple demanding responsibilities.&amp;quot;      Looking ahead, Canto will complete her Master of Accountancy in summer 2026 and has a summer internship with PwC. She also has a job offer from Forvis Mazars, where she interned last summer, and plans to complete all four sections of the CPA exam before starting full-time work in 2027. Her long-term goal is to become an audit partner at a public accounting firm, where she can mentor others and contribute to strategic financial decisions. &amp;quot;The Moore School has given me both the technical foundation and the soft skills I need to be successful,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;More importantly, it&#39;s connected me with mentors and professionals who&#39;ve guided me along the way.&amp;quot;      Her advice for future students is simple but powerful: &amp;quot;Connect with your professors early,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;They truly want the best for you and can help shape your path in ways you might not expect.&amp;quot;      As she reflects on her journey, Canto is grateful for the opportunities and challenges that shaped her. &amp;quot;The Moore School has challenged me, inspired me, and helped me discover who I want to be as a professional,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I&#39;m so thankful for every experience that&#39;s made me who I am today.&amp;quot;      -Amelia Douglas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why did you choose to attend USC and the Moore School?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose USC and the Moore School because of its leadership in international business, as well as the unique opportunity to participate in the IBEA Cohort program, gaining first-hand experience in three of the most important regions for global trade in the world. It felt like the perfect way to connect my lifelong interest in history and geopolitics with hands-on business experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What activities have you been involved in at the Darla Moore School of Business?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my involvement with the Moore School has centered around the IBEA program, which I can confidently say was the most transformative experience in my life both intellectually and personally. Being a part of the cohort gave me the opportunity to study and work alongside students from around the world while completing live-client consulting projects across Germany, Singapore and Brazil. Through the program, I&#39;ve built lifelong friendships across the globe, gained a deeper understanding of global business, and developed a truly global perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why did you specifically choose the Master of International Business?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to pursue the MIB program because it allowed me to build upon both my professional consulting experience and recent global exposure while developing specialized skills through the Global Strategy track. Through my undergraduate experience, I had seen the many complexities of international business first-hand, ranging from regulatory challenges, geopolitical tensions and cultural barriers, and the MIB program would help me to continue to develop the skills I need to succeed in this increasingly complex and shifting global environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What skills did you learn in the MIB program?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIB program has given me a blend of analytical, strategic and cross-cultural skills that I know will stay with me throughout my career. I&#39;ve learned how to approach complex business challenges through a global lens, combining data-driven analysis with an understanding of how culture, politics and economics shape decisions. The program strengthened my ability to lead multicultural teams, communicate across borders and think critically about how global markets are connected. It also pushed me to become more adaptable, curious and confident navigating the increasingly complex world of global business today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How has your engagement at the Moore School shaped your perspective on business, teamwork, or leadership?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time at the Moore School has completely reshaped how I view business as a whole. I&#39;ve learned to see business as a deeply interconnected system rather than something confined to one country or market. Every class, project and team experience has reinforced how culture, communication and collaboration shape strategic decisions. Working with classmates from around the world taught me to listen more carefully, adapt my leadership style and approach problems with a global mindset. The Moore School helped me understand that effective business leadership in today&#39;s world means being able to connect across cultures, build mutual understanding and create solutions that work on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How have your study abroad experiences through the University of South Carolina in Germany, Singapore and Brazil influenced your learning experience?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying in Germany, Singapore and Brazil gave me a truly global education. Each location offered a unique perspective on how a region&#39;s economic, political and cultural environment shape business strategy. These experiences challenged me to adapt quickly, think globally and communicate across cultures – skills that have become central to how I approach problem-solving and leadership today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was it like volunteering at the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, and how did this experience influence your perspective on global business and international relations?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteering at the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro was one of the most inspiring experiences of my academic journey. As someone who has always been passionate about world history, global issues and geopolitics, being able to contribute to such an important event and be in the presence of the world&#39;s most influential leaders as they collaborate on critical global issues was a surreal experience that served to greatly deepen my passion for international business. Being able to experience an environment like the G20 first-hand gave me a deeper appreciation for how interconnected global business and diplomacy truly are. I saw how decisions made in one room can influence markets and communities across the world. It reminded me that effective leadership, whether in government or business, requires understanding the broader systems we operate in and the importance of collaboration in addressing shared global challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What career path are you pursuing after graduation, and how has the Moore School prepared you to succeed in that field?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently pursuing a career in management consulting. I had the opportunity to complete several live-client consulting projects both through the IBEA program and the MIB during my time at the Moore School which gave me hands-on experience working in the field across different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are your future career goals?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to continue to develop through a career in management consulting/corporate strategy. I want to build a career focusing on the intersection of international business, global strategy and geopolitics, analyzing how global markets, trade and policy shape business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Balancing company priorities with the needs of its people MHR candidate ready to begin career with IBM      Master of Human Resources graduate Javona Swann, &#39;25, says her journey to the University of South Carolina was guided by faith, purpose and timing. &amp;quot;The answer to why I chose USC and the Moore School is simple,&amp;quot; Swann says. &amp;quot;I felt led to come here by the Lord.&amp;quot;      At the time, she was working with Morgan Stanley in a good job that offered stability but not a clear path toward future growth or personal development. Then, in what she describes as a moment of divine direction, she found herself searching online for information about the Moore School&#39;s Master of Human Resources program. &amp;quot;I called and got more information from the program advisor, applied within a week and was admitted the next day,&amp;quot; she recalls. &amp;quot;Now that I&#39;m here, I&#39;m so grateful. I feel like this was the right place for me to be at the right time.&amp;quot;      From her first semester, Swann says she admired the program&#39;s rigor, professionalism and sense of community. &amp;quot;All of the faculty are extremely knowledgeable and genuinely care about students both inside and outside of the classroom,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;We meet top HR executives on a weekly and sometimes daily basis – a one-of-a-kind experience that I don&#39;t believe is offered at any other program.&amp;quot;      This consistent exposure to industry leaders has shaped Swann into not just an HR professional but a future business leader.      Before joining the Moore School, Swann worked in talent development and program management – experiences that brought a real-world perspective to her coursework. &amp;quot;Having work experience gave me a pulse on the real-world issues that employees and HR practitioners were experiencing,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I was able to share that with my cohort. My previous roles helped add richness to my time in the classroom.&amp;quot;      Through both her prior experience and her time in the program, Swann has developed a powerful understanding of leadership and teamwork. &amp;quot;This program definitely prepares you for corporate life,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;You work in teams you don&#39;t choose and must depend on one another all semester. It teaches you how to recognize strengths in others, have difficult conversations, be vulnerable and forgive quickly.&amp;quot;      For Swann, great leadership is rooted in empathy and discretion. &amp;quot;To be successful in HR, you have to balance the priorities of the company with the needs of its people,&amp;quot; she explains. &amp;quot;You&#39;re often speaking with individuals about the most personal parts of their lives – from compensation and family planning to how valued they feel in the workplace.&amp;quot;      Her advice for future HR professionals is both practical and heartfelt: &amp;quot;Learn the business and its strategic objectives, care about the people you work for, speak up and make recommendations that serve both the organization and the people. And above all to take care of yourself so you can show up well for others.&amp;quot;      This January, Swann will take the next step in her career by moving to New York to begin her role as a compensation specialist at IBM.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Balancing work and &#39;prestigious&#39; PMBA program Professional MBA graduate reflects on valuable experience of program and immediate real-time applications to his current Volvo role      Professional MBA candidate Eric Abdullah, &#39;25, had to trade his Clemson tiger stripes for Gamecock spurs to enroll in the Darla Moore School&#39;s Professional MBA program, but as he approaches graduation, he says he has gained so much valuable experience in the PMBA program.      Drawn by the Moore School&#39;s national reputation for excellence and the flexibility of the PMBA program, Abdullah saw it as the ideal place to elevate his career while continuing to work full time. He is currently an indirect procurement buyer for Volvo Car USA.      Though choosing USC&#39;s PMBA program meant leaving behind his undergraduate roots at Clemson, he knew the Moore School offered the prestige, rigor and real-world relevance he needed to grow as a business leader. &amp;quot;The Moore School has a reputation for one of the best MBA programs in the country, and I wanted to complete my MBA at a prestigious business school,&amp;quot; Abdullah says.      While the program&#39;s reputation stood out, its structure played an equally important role in his decision. &amp;quot;The PMBA also offered a very flexible schedule, which made it appealing so I could complete classes around my work schedule,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Coming from Clemson, it was naturally a tough moral decision, but the right decision nonetheless!&amp;quot;      The Professional MBA program aligned perfectly with Abdullah&#39;s career goals. Already building a career in supply chain, he found the course offerings and specializations directly relevant. &amp;quot;It gave me the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of advanced business concepts and apply what I learned directly to my job in real time,&amp;quot; he says.      Collaboration has been a key part of Abdullah&#39;s experience. &amp;quot;My classmates have been a great resource for me in the program and in the business world as well,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;It&#39;s been incredibly valuable to hear their insights on class topics shaped by their perspectives of their professions and industries.&amp;quot;      Balancing work and academics was still challenging. &amp;quot;It&#39;s hard to find time for assignments on weekdays,&amp;quot; Abdullah says. &amp;quot;I found early on that it&#39;s extremely important to block time on weekends to complete class responsibilities.&amp;quot;      One of the most valuable lessons from the program has been thinking strategically and critically in his role. &amp;quot;In my current procurement role, part of my responsibility is to create long-term value, not just quick wins,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;The case discussions in the PMBA program have informed the sourcing strategies I develop at work.&amp;quot;      Looking ahead, Abdullah plans to leverage his Professional MBA experience to advance in his career as the program has enhanced his skills and growth. &amp;quot;The program has strengthened my skills, and I intend to use that growth to position myself for a future leadership role within my organization,&amp;quot; Abdullah says.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Childhood dream meets real-world immersion MIB graduate transforming her longtime passion for Mandarin culture into a multinational career      Master of International Business candidate Ella Hammond,&#39;25, has spent her time at the Darla Moore School of Business building a bridge between language, culture and global strategy. What began as a seventh-grade interest in Mandarin Chinese grew into an academic path that took her across East Asia and ultimately shaped her vision for a global career.      Hammond says that when she began applying to colleges, she was &amp;quot;looking for a way to connect language learning, business education and learning about global markets.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;When I saw that USC had the No. 1 international business program in the nation, everything came together,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Then I discovered the International Business Chinese Enterprise (IBCE) program, and I knew I had to apply.&amp;quot;      The IBCE program offered exactly what she was looking for – getting to spend semesters abroad in both Taipei and Hong Kong. &amp;quot;Once I was accepted, committing to the program was a no-brainer,&amp;quot; she says.      Hammond entered USC with another major goal of graduating early. She started planning during her freshman year, meeting with her advisor to map out a three-year course schedule. That conversation introduced her to the Accelerated Master of International Business pathway, which would allow her to take graduate courses during her undergraduate studies and complete her Master of International Business in just one additional semester. &amp;quot;Hearing it was possible to finish both degrees in three and a half years aligned perfectly with my goals,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;But it also gave me the chance to keep developing my passion for global business.&amp;quot;      Hammond&#39;s semesters abroad became the defining experiences of her time at USC. In Taipei, she immersed herself in Mandarin while exploring a culture that blends centuries-old Chinese heritage with cutting-edge innovation. Living in Taiwan during a period of heightened geopolitical tension gave her a deeper perspective on resilience, identity and global perception. &amp;quot;Seeing values, traditions and peoples criticized by the Chinese media and misunderstood by the Western media, thrive unapologetically on a daily basis was truly humbling and beautiful,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;It made me gain a whole new perspective on the local community.&amp;quot;      Hammond&#39;s semester at The Chinese University of Hong Kong strengthened her business foundation. Coursework in localized marketing, financial valuation, sustainability and legal systems sharpened her understanding of how markets operate across borders. She says her greatest lessons came from the people she met. &amp;quot;Living in an international dorm gave me friendships with students from every continent,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Hearing their stories – from growing up in Macau to working in Morocco – expanded my global perspective more than anything else.&amp;quot;      After graduation, Hammond will move to Denver, where she has accepted a position with British Aerospace Systems working in Program Control Finance for the company&#39;s Space and Mission Systems business segment. Her long-term goal is to continue building expertise in aerospace and defense, particularly in government contracting, project finance and international capability development for allied nations. She says she is also considering enrolling in a Ph.D. program that focuses on global markets, political economy and cross-border business strategy.   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Balancing the classroom and the court Gamecock athlete balances rigorous courses and D1 basketball with enriching study abroad experience      From the basketball court to international classrooms, Eli Sparkman &#39;25 finance and international business, has made the most of every opportunity the Darla Moore School of Business has to offer — combining athletic discipline, academic excellence and a passion for global business.      Sparkman was drawn to the Moore School&#39;s top-ranked international business program for its global focus and career preparation. &amp;quot;I always had aspirations of living abroad after graduating,&amp;quot; Sparkman says. &amp;quot;The international business program provides students with the education and resources to be successful wherever they want to go. Whether it&#39;s study abroad experiences, professional development or classes tailored to your career interests, the Moore School truly has something for everyone.&amp;quot;      Those opportunities came to life during his semester abroad in Santiago, Chile, where Sparkman immersed himself in a new culture and gained a deeper understanding of global perspectives. &amp;quot;My advisor was helpful throughout the entire process,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;We had sessions about culture shock and adapting to a new way of life, and the cultural understanding I gained from my classes made the experience even more meaningful.&amp;quot;      As a Division I basketball player, Sparkman also learned lessons in teamwork, resilience and time management that translated directly into his success in the classroom. &amp;quot;Playing basketball at this level is demanding, but it&#39;s taught me to manage my time and resources effectively,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Balancing academics and athletics isn&#39;t always easy, but it&#39;s been an incredibly rewarding experience.&amp;quot;      After completing his undergraduate degree, Sparkman is continuing his studies through the Accelerated Master of International Business program, further preparing for a career that will take him across borders and industries. &amp;quot;I loved my undergraduate international business classes and experiences,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;After my semester in Chile, I knew I wanted to live and work abroad, and the MIB program is helping me take that next step.&amp;quot;      From balancing Division I athletics to studying abroad and pursuing graduate-level coursework, Eli Sparkman&#39;s journey embodies the Built @ Moore School spirit — one defined by ambition, adaptability and a global vision for the future.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;How USC changed my life:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Master of Human Resources program at the Darla Moore School of Business has made a tremendous impact on me. I entered the program with only minor knowledge of the field, and now I approach graduation with an enlarged passion for how HR acts as the intersection between people and the business. I have also seen my confidence grow over the last year as I took on leadership positions and challenged myself to speak up in the classroom. Additionally, I have made lifelong connections through this program that I will leverage professionally and personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A favorite memory:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite memories while enrolled at USC was my study abroad experience in Singapore. I spent a week in Singapore alongside 20 classmates and two professors. Not only did I immerse myself in a culture that is different from my own, but I also got the chance to witness international business culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advice for incoming students:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice to incoming students is to make as many connections as possible, including professors, classmates and companies that visit campus. You never know how someone may be able to support you years down the road, as well as how you can be a valuable resource to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I&#39;ve learned about myself:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that while I am typically a &amp;quot;Type A&amp;quot; individual or a &amp;quot;perfectionist,&amp;quot; it is okay to make mistakes or ask for help along the way. I found myself producing better work and thinking more strategically as I collaborated with other students on class assignments and special projects. My willingness to be either a leader or a team player is a transferable skill that I will take with me as I begin my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What played a role in my success:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Julian Dalzell played a pivotal role in my development through the MHR program. He challenged me to think about my life and career with a global lens. This led me to pursue an internship and career with an international Fortune 100 company, as well as enroll in a study abroad course during my time at USC. Professor Dalzell never hesitated to have authentic conversations and give well-thought-out advice to me throughout the program, all of which I will hold on to preciously as I begin my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&#39;s next:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following graduation, I will relocate to Lake County, Illinois, to begin my full-time career at AbbVie as a Human Resources Leadership Development Program (HRLDP) participant.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Adapting &#39;quickly and approach challenges with curiosity&#39; International business cohort graduate prepares for a career in global corporate law      As graduation approaches, Macaria Cheatham, &#39;25 finance and international business, says she is grateful she chose to enroll in the International Business and Chinese Enterprise (IBCE) Cohort program, which allowed her to study for a year in Hong Kong and spend a summer in Taiwan. &amp;quot;When I first learned about the IBCE program, it felt like the perfect fit,&amp;quot; Cheatham says. &amp;quot;I took three years of language classes and now I&#39;m on my third year of Chinese culture courses. Academically and professionally, it&#39;s expanded my cultural knowledge and solidified my interest in working with international companies.&amp;quot;      Living abroad also pushed Cheatham to grow in new ways. &amp;quot;One of the most valuable lessons I took away from living in Hong Kong and Taiwan is independence,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Being 14 hours ahead of my family in Utah meant I couldn&#39;t always rely on them — I had to figure things out on my own. Those experiences taught me how to adapt quickly and approach challenges with curiosity.&amp;quot;      Back on campus, Cheatham continued to broaden her global understanding through the Accelerated Master of International Business program, international guest lectures and collaboration with students from across the world. &amp;quot;The Moore School has continuously encouraged global engagement — from fireside chats to courses with exchange students,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Through these opportunities, my perspective on business and culture has expanded enormously.&amp;quot;      Alongside her international business-related activities, Cheatham joined the Women in Business Council as a freshman and later joined Sigma Omega Upsilon (SOU), an international business fraternity that gave her opportunities to lead and mentor others. &amp;quot;Since being in SOU, I&#39;ve held positions as professional chair and Sigma education chair,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Helping new members through our Personal Development Program has been incredibly rewarding.&amp;quot;      Along with the skills she gained with her extracurricular involvement, Cheatham&#39;s time abroad and in the classroom has inspired her next goal: pursuing global corporate law. &amp;quot;I realized I could combine my interests in law and international business,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Global corporate law allows me to use my business and financial background while working across borders — it feels perfectly tailored to me.&amp;quot;      She plans to take a year to complete another master&#39;s program abroad before applying to law schools in major U.S. cities like Boston, Seattle and New York, with the long-term goal of working in international corporate law. &amp;quot;The advice I&#39;d give anyone pursuing a similar path is to be confident in yourself,&amp;quot; Cheatham says. &amp;quot;Law is demanding, and the process can be uncertain — but believing in your abilities and connecting with mentors will take you farther than you think.&amp;quot;      From Utah to Columbia to Hong Kong and beyond, Macaria Cheatham&#39;s journey embodies the Moore School&#39;s mission — to shape curious, globally minded leaders ready to navigate the world with confidence and purpose.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A &#39;strategic approach to understanding international organizations and markets&#39; Graduate&#39;s global journey from the Moore School to the Middle East      For Camille Mueller, &#39;25, economics and international business, the Darla Moore School of Business offered more than a degree — it opened the door to a global education shaped by cultural immersion, academic rigor and meaningful growth. Drawn by the school&#39;s top-ranked international business program and global focus, Mueller found a home where she could merge her academic interests with her passion for culture and connection. &amp;quot;I knew from the beginning of my college search that I wanted a university that would challenge me to think beyond my own borders,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;The Moore School&#39;s global partnerships and study abroad opportunities aligned perfectly with my desire to explore new perspectives and cultures while building a strong foundation in business.&amp;quot;      That global curiosity led Mueller to pursue the IBMENA (International Business Middle East and North Africa) program — a year-long academic exchange based in Cairo. There, she immersed herself in the language, culture and economic landscape of a region experiencing rapid transformation. &amp;quot;The Middle East and North Africa had fascinated me for a long time,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;The IBMENA program allowed me to explore emerging markets, regional development and cross-cultural management in depth.&amp;quot;      While she traveled briefly to Europe, Mueller emphasizes that the heart of her year abroad was spent within Egypt — experiencing the country far beyond Cairo&#39;s city center. She visited Alexandria for Eid al-Adha, explored Ain Sokhna, spent nights in the Black and White Deserts, and throughout the year traveled to Hurghada, Siwa, Dahab, Luxor, Aswan and Fayoum. She also climbed Mt. Sinai, an experience she describes as especially meaningful for her personal growth.      Her time in Egypt reshaped the way she viewed culture, communication and global business. &amp;quot;Living and studying in Egypt taught me adaptability, cultural awareness and open-mindedness,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;It challenged me to communicate across language and cultural barriers and approach unfamiliar situations with curiosity rather than hesitation.&amp;quot;      Mueller&#39;s experiences abroad also strengthened her independence and confidence in new environments. &amp;quot;Every semester I came back to Egypt brought me deeper into understanding the culture,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Through building relationships with locals and my classmates, I was able to become more comfortable in my surroundings.&amp;quot;      These experiences shaped her long-term goals and inspired her to continue her studies through the Accelerated Master of International Business (MIB) program. &amp;quot;The MIB program builds on the foundation I developed as an undergraduate and takes a more strategic approach to understanding international organizations and markets,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;It&#39;s the perfect next step toward my long-term goals.&amp;quot;      Through her studies, travels and year-long immersion in Egypt, Camille Mueller has embodied the Moore School&#39;s mission of developing globally minded, adaptable leaders. Whether in classrooms in Columbia or climbing Mt. Sinai at sunrise, she has embraced every opportunity to learn, connect and grow — proof that her education extends far beyond the walls of the university.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;First-generation dual-citizen graduate fast-tracking a global operations future Ambitious Moore School student deepens cultural understanding while building vital hard skills      Graduating in just two and a half years with a degree in operations and supply chain, Benedek Horovitz, &#39;25, has combined discipline, global experience and technical skills to build an impressive early career foundation — one that&#39;s already opening doors in health care operations. Fluent in English, Hungarian and Spanish, Horovitz recognized from the outset that the Moore School would be the ideal fit. &amp;quot;The number-one-ranked international business program definitely caught my attention because I&#39;ve always loved traveling and learning about other cultures and languages,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I wanted to go somewhere that felt global but also practical — and the Moore School really delivered on both.&amp;quot;      Horovitz entered college with 52 credits earned through Advanced Placement and dual-enrollment classes, allowing him to pursue an accelerated path and complete his degree in record time. After his first operations and supply chain course, he discovered his passion. &amp;quot;I didn&#39;t go into college planning to study supply chain, but after one lecture in assistant professor Blair Flicker&#39;s class, everything clicked,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;It combined data, problem-solving and real impact — and I loved that.&amp;quot;      A first-generation Hungarian American dual citizen, Horovitz spent the summer working in Budapest, returning to his cultural roots while gaining hands-on professional experience. There, he worked with a developer to build a web app that streamlined operations for a food delivery company that replaced its paper prep system. He continued working remotely during the semester, applying what he learned to real-world operations. &amp;quot;Budapest will always be my motherland,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Growing up between two cultures made me flexible and curious. That adaptability has helped me academically and professionally — it&#39;s one of my most valuable skills.&amp;quot;      That adaptability served him well during his supply chain internship at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, where he was selected from nearly 600 applicants. He built tools and dashboards that streamlined systems and improved efficiency across departments. &amp;quot;It was one of those moments where everything I learned at the Moore School came to life,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;It showed me how much impact good operations can have in health care.&amp;quot;      After graduation, Horovitz will return to Northwestern Medicine as a performance engineer — MMIS (Materials Management Information Systems), starting in January. In this role, he&#39;ll focus on continuous improvement projects and building dashboards and applications that support supply chain operations across the system.      Every place Horovitz has called home — from Myrtle Beach to Budapest to Chicago — has shaped the adaptable, driven person he&#39;s become. As he closes one chapter at the Moore School and begins another at Northwestern Medicine, he carries forward not only lessons in data and efficiency but also in gratitude and growth.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fourth-generation Gamecock reflects on growth and gratitude Accounting faculty inspire graduate to follow in his parents&#39; footsteps      Accounting graduate Andrew Elliott, &#39;25, wavered on his decision to enroll in the Moore School and USC but is grateful for his decision and for all the ways he&#39;s grown as a person. Noting his &amp;quot;entire family has been to USC,&amp;quot; Elliott says choosing the University of South Carolina felt both familiar and unexpectedly right. Growing up in Columbia, he considered leaving home for college but found himself drawn back after touring campus.      Within his family, there are 18 degrees in math or accounting, and both his parents are accountants. &amp;quot;Ironically, growing up, I always said I never wanted to do what my dad does,&amp;quot; Elliott says. The Moore School also offered a natural fit. &amp;quot;I really enjoyed my tour and the opportunity to be close to my mom,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Getting home-cooked meals every month has been a great pick-me-up when I needed it.&amp;quot;      He enrolled as a finance major with no plans to follow in his parents&#39; footsteps. But an introductory course quickly changed his mind. &amp;quot;My ACCT 225 class completely changed the trajectory of my time here,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I loved accounting. In many ways, it&#39;s like a big puzzle.&amp;quot;      Accounting professors such as Shannon McCutchen and Bryan Stikeleather played important roles in shaping his academic experience. &amp;quot;Even though I hate managerial accounting, I looked forward to walking into Stikeleather&#39;s class every day,&amp;quot; Elliott says. Stikeleather&#39;s managerial class confirmed that Elliott was pursuing the right career path, giving him confidence and excitement about the world of accounting.      While Elliott didn&#39;t join formal Moore School organizations, he found leadership opportunities and community involvement through his church, serving as a Life Group leader and on the student exec team for the college ministry. &amp;quot;These opportunities taught me a ton about working as part of a team,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;They provided tangible skills that have translated to success in my schoolwork and relationships. Social skills matter, caring about people on a human level matters, and building genuine relationships makes all the difference.&amp;quot;      More than any single accomplishment, Elliott is proud of the person he has become during his time at USC. &amp;quot;I came into college as a very immature kid,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I like to think I&#39;m leaving much wiser and humbler.&amp;quot; Learning to study, manage challenges and develop discipline has shaped both his academic journey and personal growth.      He has also learned that success is broader than grades or technical expertise. &amp;quot;There&#39;s a lot more to a career than raw book smarts,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Everyone has value and brings something to the table.&amp;quot; Recognizing strengths of both his own and those of others has helped him build relationships and confidence.      After graduation, Elliott will return to Elliott Davis in Columbia for a tax internship before studying for the CPA and returning to the Moore School for the Master of Accountancy program. With another graduation on the horizon in 2027, he is eager for what&#39;s ahead. &amp;quot;I can&#39;t wait to see how I learn and grow along the way,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Connecting &#39;classroom lessons to real-world opportunities&#39; Moore School and USC support and extracurriculars spark first-generation graduate&#39;s ambitions      Management, marketing and real estate graduate Amanda Glover, &#39;25, has developed an array of skills during her time in the Moore School — skills that leave her open to a myriad of future career opportunities. Before eventually declaring three different majors, Glover says her decision to attend the Moore School was inspired by her move to South Carolina, her long-standing goal to study business and her interest in an education rooted in experience and entrepreneurship.      As a first-generation college student and Rising Scholar, Glover immersed herself deeply in campus life, leadership and service. She discovered the power of community along the way. &amp;quot;The Moore School has taught me the importance of leading with both strategy and empathy,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I&#39;ve learned that business isn&#39;t just about numbers or analysis, it&#39;s also about people, communication and adaptability.&amp;quot;      Her involvement in the Rising Scholars program became a defining part of her USC experience. The Moore School&#39;s Rising Scholars program connects first-generation, low-income and South Carolina-resident Moore School students with scholarships, peer and faculty mentors and a community focused on shared success. As Head of the Philanthropy Committee for Rising Scholars, Glover planned volunteer events and community outreach projects, giving her firsthand experience in team leadership and project coordination.      &amp;quot;Rising Scholars and being a USC Housing resident assistant have given me the chance to create a sense of community and help other students feel supported,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Whether it&#39;s through my work as an RA, in Rising Scholars or on campus projects, I&#39;ve learned that business and teamwork go hand in hand.&amp;quot;      Working as the social media lead for USC Parking and Transportation Services also helped Glover combine her marketing skills with campus impact. Glover says she has been able to &amp;quot;create digital content to help students stay informed about parking and transportation on campus.&amp;quot;      One of her proudest accomplishments was launching her own advising concept, Advised by Amanda, which allowed her to pair entrepreneurship with mentorship. &amp;quot;Advising Amanda is a project I started through a class assignment and a genuine love for advising,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;It offers peer to peer guidance and feedback based on my own experiences navigating the challenges of finding the right support and resources.&amp;quot;      Glover also credits faculty members, including Kasie Whitener, management, and Anjelita Cadena, real estate, with shaping her academic direction. Their courses strengthened her interests in leadership, real estate development and strategic thinking. &amp;quot;Both professors have helped me to connect classroom lessons to real-world opportunities,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;They have encouraged me to think strategically and stay confident in my ideas.&amp;quot;      After graduation, Glover plans to earn her South Carolina Real Estate Broker License and pursue opportunities in marketing and development. She ultimately wants to open an international real estate brokerage firm and a bed and breakfast that blends her passions for hospitality and entrepreneurship. She is also considering enrolling in the Master of Human Resources from the Moore School to further develop her leadership skills. &amp;quot;Longterm, I want to create spaces that bring people together and celebrate community and culture,&amp;quot; Glover says.   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;How USC changed my life:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USC gave me the space to explore my curiosity and sharpen my ambition. Through rigorous coursework, group projects and late-night strategy sessions, I learned how to lead with both precision and intention. It is where I learned that metrics aren&#39;t just numbers; they&#39;re stories of progress. Most importantly, USC surrounded me with people who believed in excellence, collaboration and growth. Professors, peers and mentors pushed me to think bigger, engage in thoughtful dialogue and never settle for &amp;quot;good enough.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A favorite memory:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most memorable experience at the Moore School was the deep sense of connection and camaraderie I built with my cohort. From evening classes after long workdays to collaborating on group projects during the weekends, we learned together, grew together and celebrated each other&#39;s wins. These friendships were forged through shared ambition, mutual support and countless moments of laughter and growth. Equally unforgettable were the professors who challenged us to think critically, lead with purpose, and apply our learning to real-world problems. Their passion and mentorship elevated every classroom experience and inspired me to push beyond what I thought possible. Together with my peers and professors, I did not just earn a degree. I gained a community, a new lens for leadership and memories that will stay with me well beyond my time at the Moore School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advice for incoming students:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with intention. Don&#39;t chase grades – chase understanding. Don&#39;t simply ask yourself what you&#39;re learning, but why it matters and how you&#39;ll use it to make a difference. Build relationships early. Your professors, peers and mentors are catalysts in your learning experience. Engage with them, challenge ideas and welcome feedback. The best growth happens in dialogue. Own your time. College will throw a thousand opportunities your way. Choose the ones that stretch your thinking and build the skills you&#39;ll need long after graduation. Document your wins. Whether it&#39;s a breakthrough in a group project or a moment of clarity during office hours, track your progress. These reflections will fuel your confidence and shape your story. And finally, lead with both heart and rigor. The University of South Carolina will give you tools, but it&#39;s up to you to turn them into impact. Be bold, be curious and never underestimate the power of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I&#39;ve learned about myself:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That I&#39;m far more capable than I ever gave myself credit for. The unknown or unfamiliar isn&#39;t something to fear, but something to embrace. Every challenge, every pivot, every moment of uncertainty taught me that growth lives beyond comfort. I learned to trust my instincts, lean into complexity, and show up with confidence even when the path wasn&#39;t clear. College instilled resilience, adaptability and the power of believing in myself. I am reminded that when I meet the unknown with courage and curiosity, I can achieve more than I could ever imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What played a role in my success:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every professor I encountered at USC played a role in shaping my success – not just by teaching content, but by modeling curiosity, discipline and purpose. They challenged me to think critically, communicate with precision, and connect ideas to real-world outcomes. Whether it was a lecture that sparked a new perspective or feedback that pushed me to refine my work, each interaction helped me grow. Their commitment to excellence, their willingness to engage, and their belief in student potential created an environment where I could stretch, stumble and ultimately succeed. I&#39;m grateful to every professor who saw beyond the syllabus and invested in my growth. Their influence will echo in every decision I make moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&#39;s next:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation, I&#39;m planning to continue working with Aflac. When I first started the program, I had a fairly narrow view of what a career in insurance could look like. But over time, I&#39;ve been exposed to so many different paths – analytics, strategy, project management, HR – that I can now better see how my strengths can evolve in multiple directions. It&#39;s given me a clearer sense of where I can grow professionally, and I&#39;m excited to keep building on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
